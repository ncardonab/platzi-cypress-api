These are the things that I learned from this course, some of them I already knew them

1. Types of APIS are: SOAP and REST
2. We can add to the `cy.request` and option object with the property `failOnStatusCode: false` in it, in order to not fail the command even though the request failed so we can assert on that failure
3. Although this one I studied it before it's always nice to refresh it: PATCH just updates the field that were updated whereas PUT creates a whole new object
4. With GraphQL or Relational DB we can just write our queries to a single function, not as the NoSQL DB we have to create a function for every single query that we have to perform
5. GraphQL works with POST HTTP method
6. MySQL retrieves a 2 server status code denoting that everything went as planned
7. On backend testing to create a more complete testing we can mixed the API with the DB responses
